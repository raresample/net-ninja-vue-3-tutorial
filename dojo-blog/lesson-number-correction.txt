i notice that his lessons-[num] system diverges at lesson-57, where the project in repo is called “project-planner”
Hmm…not clear how to proceed from here?
Ok, so we can keep using the lesson-[num] we had been, but it’s of limited practical use
So just ripping through a bit
Tried 71, which has dojo-blog, so we’re getting warmer…
71 is well behind where we are here
80 is too far
74 is the previous lesson (“61”)
But it looks like 75 is way ahead lololol
Actually wait, it does have the
    const names = ref(['mario', 'yoshi', 'luigi', 'toad', 'bowser', 'koopa', 'peach'])
	… so this might be the sync right here
Ok, yes, this seems like it will be fine, so let’s call it lesson-75 and keep moving…
